Survival status

1. Project Objectives

The goal of this EDA is to:

Understand the structure of the Titanic dataset

Identify missing or inconsistent data

Explore how factors like age, gender, class, and fare influenced survival

Visualize patterns and relationships

Generate insights useful for predictive modeling

2. Steps Performed in the Notebook
1. Data Cleaning

Handling missing values

Converting data types

Removing irrelevant columns

Dealing with categorical values

2. Descriptive Statistics

Summary statistics

Distribution of numerical features

Value counts for categorical features

3. Visualizations

Includes different plots such as:

Histograms

Count plots

Bar charts

Survival rate comparisons

Age distribution by survival

Class-wise and gender-wise survival analysis

4. Insights & Findings

Some key insights extracted during EDA include:

Females had a higher survival rate than males

Passengers in 1st class survived more than 2nd and 3rd class

Younger passengers had higher survival chances

Higher fare often indicated better survival probability

(Your notebook will show these in detail.)
